      - generic [ref=e153]: "2565 P atients with cerebellar infarction should not be neglected because they can experience sudden clinical deterioration from cerebellar swelling. Compared with malignant middle cerebral artery infarctions, malignant cerebellar infarc- tions can be more urgent because of the smaller space of the posterior fossa, consecutive brain stem compression, and obstructive hydrocephalus. In these situations, suboccipital decompressive craniectomy (SDC) is recommended as a life- saving therapy although no randomized controlled trials on this therapy have been conducted. 1,2 Furthermore, no evidence is available on the benefits of preventive SDC for patients with cerebellar infarction, whereas the benefits of early preventive decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant middle cere- bral artery infarction are supported by randomized controlled trials. 3,4 However, a subset of patients might be expected to benefit in terms of improved survival and functional outcomes from preventive SDC. Determining how to select patients who are good candidates for preventive SDC would be useful. Thus, the purpose of this matched case–control study was to investigate whether preventive SDC was associated with good clinical outcome in patients with cerebellar infarction and to evaluate its predisposing factors. Materials and Methods Patient Selection All research protocols were approved by the institutional review board of our institute, and the need for informed consent was waived. Between March 2007 and September 2015, medical records and radiographic data of 60 patients treated with SDC were reviewed retrospectively in a prospectively collected database from 5 hospi- tals where 5 neurosurgeons, all alumni of a single institution, treated patients with cerebrovascular diseases using similar medical and sur- gical methods. Among them, 28 patients underwent preventive SDC with the following criteria: (1) the presence of cerebellar infarction; (2) initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ≥ 9; (3) without clinical Background and Purpose —No evidence is available on the benefits of preventive suboccipital decompressive craniectomy (SDC) for patients with cerebellar infarction. The purpose of this matched case–control study was to investigate whether preventive SDC was associated with good clinical outcomes in patients with cerebellar infarction and to evaluate its predisposing factors. Methods —Between March 2007 and September 2015, 28 patients underwent preventive SDC. We performed propensity score matching to establish a proper control group among 721 patients with cerebellar infarction during the same period. Group A (n=28) consists of those who underwent preventive SDC, and group B (n=56) consists of those who did not undergo preventive SDC. We analyzed and compared clinical outcomes between groups. Results — Clinical outcomes were better in group A than in group B at discharge ( P =0.048) and 12-month follow-up ( P =0.030). Group B had more deaths within 12 months than group A (log-rank, P <0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that preventive SDC (odds ratio, 4.815; P =0.009) and the absence of brain stem infarction (odds ratio, 2.862; P =0.033) were independently associated with favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2) at 12-month follow-up. Conclusions —Favorable clinical outcomes including overall survival can be expected after preventive SDC in patients with a volume ratio between 0.25 and 0.33 and the absence of brain stem infarction. Among these patients, preventive SDC might be better than the best medical treatment alone. ( Stroke . 2016;47:2565-2573. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.014078.)

      - generic [ref=e158]: "2566 Stroke October 2016 deterioration (no GCS score changes) within 72 hours from onset; and (4) a cerebellar infarction volume ratio between 0.25 and 0.33 on initial or routine follow-up radiographic findings (within 72 hours of onset) generated by computed tomography (CT) or diffusion-weighted imaging. Cerebellar infarction volume ratios were calculated using the equation: volume ratio=cerebellar infarction volume (mm 3 )/total cerebellar volume (mm 3 ). Volumes were estimated using the formula: volume (mm 3 )=(A 1 +A 2 +A 3 + ··· +A N )×H, where N indicated the num- ber of image sections that showed the cerebellum, A (area, mm 2 ) was measured manually for each image section, and H (height, mm) was 4 or 5, depending on the thickness of the image section from the CT or diffusion-weighted image. A picture archiving and communica- tion system viewer (INFINITT PiViewSTAR, INFINITT Healthcare Co., Ltd, Seoul, Korea) was used (Figure 1). Total cerebellar volume included brain stem volume. The other 32 patients underwent SDC (not preventive SDC) because of clinical deterioration, GCS score <9, or severe mass effect on radiographic images. During the same period, our database contained 1102 patients with cerebellar infarction who did not undergo preventive SDC. We excluded patients who lost follow-up (n=312, including 96 because of death) and patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≥ 1 before new clinical signs because of cerebellar infarction (n=69). Among the remaining 721 patients, we performed propensity score matching to establish a proper control group. Three independent investigators blinded to the data of the pres- ent study retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiographic data of the included patients using their medical records. Variables evaluated and compared between groups were as follows: age, sex, initial National Institutes Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, ini- tial GCS score, cause of cerebellar infarction, involved hemisphere (unilateral or bilateral), combined brain stem infarction, external ventricular drainage (EVD) for hydrocephalus, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, previous stroke, smoking, body mass index, intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), intra-arterial endovascular treatment (EVT), pre- vious myocardial infarction, coronary artery occlusive disease, peripheral artery occlusive disease, and hemorrhagic transforma- tion. Clinical outcomes were assessed with mRS. An mRS of 0 to 2 was defined as favorable; an mRS of 3 to 6 was defined as unfavor- able. We compared the overall survival and follow-up functional outcomes between the groups to evaluate effectiveness and safety of preventive SDC. We also evaluated predisposing factors that were associated with good clinical outcomes. Interventional Managements in Patients With Cerebellar Infarction All patients were evaluated by a stroke physician (neurologist or neurosurgeon) and assessed by NIHSS score on their admission. All patients underwent an initial imaging study that included a nonen- hanced CT scan with or without CT angiography and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with or without magnetic reso- nance angiography. We performed intra-arterial EVT based on the following criteria: (1) baseline NIHSS score ≥ 4; (2) no intracerebral hemorrhage detected on CT or MRI; (3) vertebral or basilar artery occlusion detected on CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiog- raphy, or conventional cerebral angiography; (4) no bilateral diffuse pontine infarction on diffusion-weighted imaging; and (5) procedure commencement within 12 hours after symptom onset. Intravenous tPA (0.9 mg/kg) was administered to patients within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Subsequent EVT as a rescue therapy was consid- ered within 1 hour of intravenous tPA in patients with no neurologi- cal improvement, defined as an unchanged or worsened NIHSS score relative to baseline. EVT was performed by means of a femoral approach without general anesthesia. In cases of agitation, an intravenous bolus of midazolam was administered and repeated if necessary. A 5F- or 6F-guiding catheter was placed in the vertebral artery. From March 2010, mechanical thrombectomy with a Solitaire stent was used as a first-line treatment option. 5,6 In the present study, 10 patients (2 in group A and 8 in group B) received mechanical thrombectomy among 14 patients who underwent intra-arterial EVT. The other 4 patients received mechanical thrombolysis without intra-arterial chemical thrombolysis. In the preset study, all patients underwent MRI on admission, after recanalization procedures (intravenous tPA or intra-arterial EVT), after clinical symptoms became aggravated or when clinical symp- toms were not correlated with CT findings. Brain stem infarction was determined via MRI. Propensity Score Matching Propensity score matching was performed using multiple logistic regression with preventive SDC versus nonpreventive SDC with respect to age, sex, initial NIHSS score, and initial GCS score. After patient matching was performed by estimated propensity scores via a conditional logistic regression method, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. Using the logit esti- mated from the log odds of the propensity score of each patient, we matched a selected case with controls who had the nearest estimated logit value by 1:2 matching. Thus, group A (n=28) con- sisted of those who underwent preventive SDC and group B (n=56) consisted of those who did not undergo preventive SDC. Balance between the 2 groups for each variable was evaluated by propen- sity score distributions, and absolute standardized differences before and after matching were calculated (Figure 2). Absolute standardized differences <0.10 implied good balance between the 2 groups. A complete set of baseline data was essential for the development of the propensity model. Thus, we replaced missing data values with the mean for that variable instead of excluding patients with any missing data. Best Medical Management The best medical treatment method was used for both groups. All patients were admitted to the stroke unit or neurosurgical intensive care unit during the acute stage. Blood pressure (BP) was monitored routinely every 15 minutes. Continuous arterial line monitoring was performed for patients who underwent surgery or with systolic BP ≥ 180 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 100 mm Hg. BP was controlled with continuous intravenous infusion of an antihypertensive agent for BP >180/100 mm Hg at the acute stage, which was later changed to oral medication. Patients with other medical histories such as hyperten- sion or diabetes mellitus, had BP lowered according to recommen- dations. 1,2,7,8 Arterial oxygen concentration was maintained within normal limits. Oxygen was administered in cases of hypoxemia. In cases of reversible respiratory insufficiency, patients were intubated and assisted with an artificial ventilator. Euvolemia was maintained with normal saline. Cardiac arrhythmias that might reduce cardiac output were corrected in consultation with cardiologists. Glucose level and body temperature were maintained within normal ranges as much as possible. Mobilization with rehabilitation therapy was started as soon as the patients were medically stable. Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants were used according to the guidelines. 1,2 When follow-up radiological findings indicated a mass effect and swelling or when clinical symptoms revealed increased intracranial pressure, hypertonic agent (mannitol) was administered. Patients did not receive steroids. Preventive SDC SDC was performed with the patient in the park-bench (three quarter) or prone position. The head was fixed with a three-pin head fixator. A unilateral EVD on the parieto-occipital point was usually set up before SDC for hydrocephalus and was performed in 14 (50.0%) patients in this study. Bilateral SDC with the opening of the foramen magnum was performed for all patients, even those with unilateral infarction. The upper and lateral margin of SDC extended as close as possible to the transverse and lateral sinuses. The dura was opened in a large Y incision. As the dura was opened and the infarcted brain began herniating outward, decompressive resection of the infarcted cerebellum was performed in 16 of 28 patients (57.1%). Duroplasty used an artificial dura. Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 1, 2025"

Student t tests were used for numeric variables. χ 2 tests were used for nominal variables. The Kaplan– Meier method was used to analyze time to death, with the log-rank test used to compare mortality between groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for favorable clinical outcomes at the 12-month follow-up. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed on variables with an unadjusted effect and P value <0.10 on simple logistic regression analysis. P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The clinical characteristics and outcomes of propensity score– matched subjects in both groups are shown in Table 1.
